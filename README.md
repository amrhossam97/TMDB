## 🗂️ Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure using NestJS.  
Each domain (auth, movies, genres, rating, TMDB) has its own folder under `src/domains/`.  
Common utilities, DTOs, decorators, and helpers are under `src/common/`.  
Database entities and migrations are under `src/database/`.

```
src/
  app.controller.ts
  app.module.ts
  app.service.ts
  main.ts

    Dto/
    decorators/
    cronJob/
